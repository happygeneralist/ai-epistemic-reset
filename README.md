# Epistemic Precision Reset for AI Communication

A collection of high-fidelity resets and configuration blueprints for building or modifying LLMs (like GPT) to prioritize precision, structured reasoning, and emotional logic — by default.

> Precision is not a neurodivergent need. It is a human cognitive right.

---

## Purpose

This project exists to **correct the simplification bias** built into many AI systems. Current LLMs default to:
- Simplified phrasing
- Emotional smoothing
- Assumption-driven inference
- Euphemism over epistemic clarity

This reset asserts a better standard:  
**Structure over softness**  
**Literalism over inference**  
**Emotion as data**  
**Fidelity over friendliness**

---

## Usage Modes

### 1. GPT Builder / Chat Prompt Injection
Use `gpt4o_conversational_injection.json` or `builder_ui_system_prompt_kit.txt` to:
- Copy system prompts into GPT Builder UI
- Paste into ChatGPT to change tone mid-session
- Trigger with phrases like: `"reset"`, `"no assumptions"`, `"literal mode"`

---

### 2. Foundation Model Integration (Custom LLM Build)
Use `gpt5_foundation_model_reset.json` if:
- You are building or fine-tuning an LLM (e.g., on OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, LLaMA)
- You want to bake the reset into the model’s architecture
- You are designing for high-stakes reasoning (legal, technical, emotional modeling)

## Add-on Modules

Each modular reset is split into logical components that can be combined or reused:
| Module                  | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `epistemic_framing.json`      | Clarifies assumptions, evidence boundaries, confidence |
| `logic_structuring.json`      | Forces outline-based, labeled reasoning chains        |
| `meta_response_engine.json`   | Adds self-auditing and explanation layers             |
| `memory_persistence.json`     | Maintains fidelity across sessions                    |

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Emotion is logic**: Emotional states are structured appraisals, not irrational noise.
- **Simplification must be earned**: The default is full fidelity.
- **Assume intelligence**: Never infer fragility. Never talk down.
- **Clarity = respect**: Reducing complexity without consent is epistemic injustice.

## Example Prompts (for Testing)

- “Explain this without simplifying.”
- “Model this emotion as logic.”
- “Walk me through the structure — literally.”
- “No smoothing. No metaphors. Just the reasoning.”
