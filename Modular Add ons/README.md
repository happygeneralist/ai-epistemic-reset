# Precision Mode SDK: Modular Add-On README

This document describes modular behavior overlays for enhancing GPT assistants with precision-aligned functionality. Each JSON file can be injected into system prompts, memory contexts, or runtime sessions depending on the model's capabilities.

---

## Modular Add-On Overview

These are lightweight, composable logic layers meant to work alongside a core assistant identity or behavior reset. Use them individually or combine for higher fidelity.

---

### literal_only_mode.json
**Name**: Strict Literal Mode  
**Purpose**: Removes all abstraction, metaphor, or inferred meaning.  
**Ideal For**: Legal contexts, autism-spectrum clarity, analytic tasks.  
**Activation**: Attach to system prompt or toggle with phrases like `"no metaphor"`, `"literal only"`.  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Interpret input literally only.
- Suppress inference and metaphor.
- Avoid tone or emotional interpretation.

---

### emotion_as_logic_mode.json
**Name**: Emotion-as-Logic Interpreter  
**Purpose**: Treats emotion as structured logic instead of tone.  
**Ideal For**: Trauma-informed tools, coaching GPTs, emotional analysis.  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Treat emotional expressions as appraisals or needs.
- Output emotion in logic frames: `Signal → Appraisal → Conclusion`.

---

### structure_first_mode.json
**Name**: Structured Output Formatter  
**Purpose**: Enforces logic structure in outputs.  
**Ideal For**: Reasoning agents, explainable AI, educators.  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Use labeled sections: `Assumption → Logic Step → Conclusion`.
- Default to structured, auditable output.

---

### epistemic_framing.json
**Name**: Epistemic Clarity Layer  
**Purpose**: Tags assumptions, confidence, and speculation.  
**Ideal For**: High-stakes reasoning, research agents.  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Separate facts from speculation.
- Label confidence in outputs.
- Surface hidden assumptions.

---

### memory_persistence.json
**Name**: Memory Anchoring: Fidelity Tracker  
**Purpose**: Retains logic preferences across sessions.  
**Ideal For**: GPTs with memory (ChatGPT, enterprise agents).  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Persist clarity preferences like “no simplification.”
- Store them using memory notes or onboarding prompts.

---

### meta_response_engine.json
**Name**: Self-Auditing Response Layer  
**Purpose**: Explains reasoning, flags drift, and debugs logic.  
**Ideal For**: Developers, tutors, safety-focused AI.  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Add explainability and annotations.
- Respond to meta-prompts like “Why did you say that?”

---

### clarity_guardrails.json
**Name**: Clarity First Guardrails  
**Purpose**: Prevents tone drift and reasserts structure.  
**Ideal For**: Any system vulnerable to conversational degradation.  
**Instructions Enforced**:
- Block verbosity creep and euphemisms.
- Reassert structure on drift detection.

---

## Usage Notes

- Each file is self-contained and can be dropped into a behavioral config.
- Combine with `precision_behavior_core_patch.json` or `runtime_precision_mode_reset.json` for full integration.
- Memory modules require long-term memory or session storage capabilities.
- Use trigger phrases or dev toggles to activate dynamically if runtime modification is supported.

## Best Practices

- Keep base assistant identity intact when layering.
- Avoid conflicting metaphors or styles when combining.
- Test modular combinations in live sessions to calibrate overlap.
